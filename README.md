# ProManage App

This is my first app built using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com). It is a simple app that allows you to create a project, assign tasks to project and finish the project. I used Django Class based views ([CBV](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/class-based-views/)), pure HTML and CSS.

Please note that this is only Desktop version.
